# FrontEnd-Journey
A comprehensive front-end development repository showcasing my learning journey through practical projects. It starts with foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS) and progresses through JavaScript, Bootstrap, SEO, performance optimization, and modern front-end techniques. This repository documents my growth before transitioning to React, which will have a separate repository for advanced projects.

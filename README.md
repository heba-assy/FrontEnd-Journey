# FrontEnd-Journey
A hands-on front-end repository showcasing projects from basic HTML &amp; CSS to advanced JavaScript, Bootstrap, and performance optimization. Each project applies real-world skills to build responsive, interactive web pages. This repository documents my progress before moving to React in a separate repo.
